description: Developed a machine learning model for a CPSC 440 Advanced ML and AI course to predict surface features of 3D objects from Point Clouds. We tried different clustering algorithms on surface normals of point clouds to produce features for the linear classifier to predict surface features of 3D objects. Designed the architecture and implemented the training and prediction of the Linear Classifier model in PyTorch. Explored literary research in subject area and assessed each method along with the results to compare with our use case.
